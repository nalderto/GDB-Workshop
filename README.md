# GDB-Workshop

Oh no!  Noah made some bugs while making this Twitter program!  Help him fix them by using your newly acquired skills of GDB, Vim, and Valgrind.  

1. Whenever he tries to reply to a parent tweet, the program segfaults.  Use GDB to try to find and fix the segfault.  

2. This program has memory leak!  Use Valgrind to find what memory is leaking and try to fix it.  You will only need to add a single line of code to fix the memory leak.

3.  Using Vim, switch the `else if` statements for input conditions 1 and 2 without going into insert mode. (Hint: use visual mode)

4. And of course, I can't spell the word "coming."  Using Vim, find and replace "comming" with "coming", while keeping your cursor on the first line.
